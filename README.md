simple barcode scanning and record keeping

This will be a simple Rails app for keeping track of any numbers or other bits of data you need to keep track of that are encoded as barcodes (although values can of course be typed in by hand).

For example, if you receive enough shipments through UPS, FedEx, etc. that you need to keep your own records of what came in when.
